		<h1>John-117</h1>
		<h2>The best Spartan mankind has ever seen</h2>

		<p><a href="https://halo.fandom.com/es/wiki/John-117" target="_blank">John 117</a> is the best "weapon" that humanity has been able to create. He alone has been able to annihilate an entire army with unprecedented speed and efficiency. He and his team, the Blue Team, have participated in more missions than any other member of the UNSC.</p>


		<p>This valued member has spoiled so many <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/es/wiki/Covenant" target="_blank">CovenantÂ´s</a>   plans, they fear him, calling him "demon". And with good reason,  he's been through the entire universe, so many battles and still no one has been able to defeat him. He has earned the respect, admiration and fear of his enemies</p>


		<p>The day he is missing, it will be a great loss for our species that will have to wait for another super-soldier like him to emerge. But we all know that there will be no one who resembles him</p>
